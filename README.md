# Interview Scheduler

The Interview Scheduler application is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application that allows a student to create, edit and delete interview appointments.

## Purpose

I created the Interview Scheduler application while completing the [Lighthouse Labs](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs) [Web Development Flex Program](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-flex-program). 

Data is retrieved from an [API](https://github.com/todd-demone/scheduler-api) provided by Lighthouse Labs. Testing was performed using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework and the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) visual test bed.
