## Purpose

I created the Interview Scheduler application while completing the [Lighthouse Labs](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs) [Web Development Flex Program](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-flex-program). 

The application was made with [React](https://reactjs.org/). 

Data is retrieved from an [API](https://github.com/todd-demone/scheduler-api) provided by Lighthouse Labs.

Testing was performed using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework and the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) visual test bed.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run the app using the following commands in the terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:todd-demone/scheduler.git
cd scheduler
npm install     // install all of the dependencies
npm start       // start the Webpack development server
```

To use the app, go to <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.
